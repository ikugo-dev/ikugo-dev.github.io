Hi, I’m Aleksandar Ristić, a Software Engineering student at the Faculty of Electronic Engineering in Niš, Serbia.
I love programming in all its forms, from low-level systems to backend development, and I’ve spent years sharpening my skills through personal projects and exploring new ideas.

Over the years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects and become a bit of a jack of all trades.
I enjoy collaborating with others, solving challenging problems, and building clean, efficient, and scalable solutions.
Writing simple, maintainable code is something I take pride in, and I’m always eager to learn and improve.

When I’m not programming, I enjoy music, art, movies, and cooking.
I like spending my free time being creative, whether it’s drawing or experimenting with new coding ideas.
For me, every day is a chance to grow and create something meaningful.
